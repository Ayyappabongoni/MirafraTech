String is a sequence of characters terminated by a null character ('\0'), while an array can store any type of data including characters.

Strings are usually used to represent text data, while arrays can be used to store any kind of data including text, numbers, and other data types.

String literals (e.g. "hello") are stored in a read-only data segment of the program's memory, while arrays are stored on the stack or the heap depending on how they are declared and used.

There are specialized functions for working with strings, such as strlen(), strcpy(), strcat(), strcmp(), etc. These functions are not applicable to arrays in general.

Arrays have a fixed size that is determined at the time of declaration, while strings can have variable length and can be resized using functions like malloc() and realloc().

Arrays can be multidimensional (i.e. arrays of arrays), while strings are usually represented as one-dimensional arrays of characters.
